{"name":"Xlsbtab","tagline":"SBtab Excel 2013 Add-In","body":"## xlSBtab - an SBtab Excel 2013 Add-in \r\nThis project hosts a basic Excel Plugin, for opening an [SBML](http://sbml.org) file within Excel and have it be converted to the SBtab format. Alternatively a file edited in the [SBtab](http://sbtab.net/) format can be exported as SBML file. \r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nFor the program to work, you will need to have the following installed: \r\n\r\n* a version of [python 2.x](http://python.org)\r\n* the [libSBML python bindings](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) for that python version\r\n* Excel 2013 to run the plugin\r\n* a checkout of the [SBtab repository](https://github.com/derHahn/SBtab)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nAfter you installed the plugin, you will find a new tab called 'SBtab' in the Add-ins ribbon menu. On that tab, click settings to verify the python path, and the SBtab location. \r\n\r\nThe add in has four options: \r\n\r\n![SBTab options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbergmann/xlSBtab/master/images/addin_options.png)\r\n\r\n* **Import SBML**: imports an SBML file and replaces the contents of the current sheet with SBtab tables representing that file.\r\n* **Export SBML**: translates the tables of the current sheet back into an SBML file. \r\n* **Validate**: currently ensures only that the tables have the expected headers. It does not yet validate the entries in the table. \r\n* **Settings**: specify the path to the python interpreter, and the SBtab script directory. \r\n\r\nOnce a model is imported it will be displayed like in the example below (here BioModel 10 was imported): \r\n\r\n![SBtab of BioModel 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fbergmann/xlSBtab/master/images/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is open source and freely available under the [Simplified BSD](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) license.
